## About

This meetup is dedicated to the topic of Software Verification. What is Software
Verification? There are a number of definitions of software verification but
let’s keep it simple: software verification is everything we can do to prove
that our software works. Even more informally: software verification goes beyond
what is possible with “just testing” software and covers many other topics
including:

- More advanced methods of testing: model checking, abstract interpretation,
  symbolic execution, MC/DC coverage, mutation testing, fuzzing
- Automatic test generation, automatic program repair
- Formal methods, formal verification: Coq, Idris, Agda, Isabelle/HOL, Dataflow
  analysis, Type theory, etc.
- Safety-critical software, software safety assessment, RAMS and FDIR
- Development and qualification of software according to the industry standards,
  such as ISO26262, MISRA, DO-178, ECSS, etc.
- Model-based software development and verification

The idea of the meetup is to gather people interested in the above topics and to
listen together to the interesting presentations about software verification.

A few founding principles:

- **We welcome both industry and research**. Software verification is a broad
  area with a wide range of topics and we welcome any of the above or related
  topics to be presented. Not sure whether your topic is a good fit? Just ask
  the organizer.

- **Offline and Online**. We are considering both options: offline and online.
  If we find a speaker who is in Berlin, we do an offline meetup. If we find a
  speaker who would like to present remotely, we can organize a public Zoom call
  with a link posted to the meetup event, here on meetup.com.

- **Video recording of the meetups**. We intend to do a recording of the meetups
  and every speaker is free to opt-in or opt-out for their presentations to be
  recorded or not.

- **We are actively looking for speakers who would like to present**.

Let’s see how many people are interested in this meetup and let’s see how many
speakers we can find.
