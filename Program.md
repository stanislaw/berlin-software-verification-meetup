### Meetup #1 (offline): Software Verification for Developers (January 15, 2020)

Video recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZNtu4TMz8

I am happy to announce the first meetup and the first speaker.

Dr. Yegor Derevenets – "Software Verification for Developers"

The abstract:

```
Sometimes, when you build software, you want to be sure that you have built it
right. Examples include software for safety-critical systems, code that works
with data from untrusted sources (e.g., protocol parsers), parallel
algorithms, which are usually impossible to get right the first time, and many
more. Software verification gives you a helping hand in such cases.

In this talk I will give an overview of the software verification methods and
highlight those that can be used without diving deeply into the theory. The
survey will cover methods for ensuring correctness: theorem proving, model
checking, — as well as methods for bug hunting: from good old testing to
automatic test generation using concolic testing and fuzzing, and making
compiler write checks for you.

Yegor is a Software Engineer at Yandex.Technology GmbH.

I didn't have to look for the next speaker. He has found us!

Evgenii Kuznetcov – "Introduction to Coq theorem prover"

The abstract:

```
In this talk, I'm going to show the power of Coq proof assistant. We will go
through usage examples, do some live coding. In the meanwhile, I'll be making
an overview of beautiful ideas behind this language such as inductive data
types and Curry-Howard correspondence.

Evgenii Kuznetcov is a software developer at Adsquare. Functional programming
enthusiast.
```

Location and time: February 26th, 18:00.

### Meetup #3 (online): Building SW everyone can trust: Safety requirements in Automotive applications (March 18, 2020)

Video recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLG0R9cvfk8&feature=youtu.be

I am happy to announce the third meetup and this time we are going to do it
online. Most likely we will use a Zoom call but I am still deciding on this.
Stay tuned, the details will follow!

Oleg Kirovskii – "Building SW everyone can trust: Safety requirements in
Automotive applications"

The abstract:

```
For many applications, SW is at the same time key enabler and the main risk;
it may create millions of profits or cause a disastrous accident killing the
project. Another difference between HW and SW is the non-random nature of SW
faults: every bug we produce goes into each copy of SW; it will definitely
manifest under certain conditions. Due to all this, specific safety
requirements were put on SW, its composition, quality, and development
processes. This presentation presents a high-level overview of the
requirements. It introduces the concepts of ISO 26262 standard, explaining its
view on the terms everyone seems to understand a bit differently: safety,
risk, harm, etc. The approaches to be outlined here are coming from the
Automotive engineering community. However, they are also good to handle any
kind of unwanted events caused by unexpected SW behavior: both related to
safety in other fields (machinery, aerospace, etc.) and not directly
safety-related.

About Oleg: Oleg Kirovskii graduated from Bauman Moscow State Technical
University in 2009. Since then, he is trying to solve a single question: "How
to make complex systems safe?" - first in academia, and since 2012 in the
industry. Since 2014, Oleg concentrates on automotive electronics: first,
passive safety applications, and starting from August 2017 on driver
assistance and autonomous driving.

Agenda:

- 19:00: Intro and Presentation
- 20:00-20:15: Time for questions

### Meetup #4 (online): MISRA C and its key role for the compliance to industrial safety standards (April 21, 2020)

[Join this event](https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Software-Verification-Meetup/events/269550463/)

Our fourth event is going to be an online event in the form of a webinar (\~75
minutes). Zoom has proven to work well for us for the third meetup so we are
also going to use it for this event.

Let me introduce our next presenter:

Roberto Bagnara – "MISRA C and its key role for the compliance to industrial
safety standards"

The abstract:

```
Embedded software plays a steadily increasing role in all industrial
sectors, and in several such sectors software is responsible for functionality
impacting the overall system safety and security. As a result an increasing
number of companies and projects are required to comply to industry safety
standards (CENELEC EN 50128, ECSS-Q-ST-80C, FDA "General Principles of Software
Validation", IEC 61508, IEC 62304, ISO 26262, RTCA DO-178C). In this seminar we
will focus on one of the key aspects of such standards: this is the possibility
to program in subsets of standardized languages such as "C" or "C++". Starting
from an introduction to the traps and pitfalls of the "C" programming language,
we will present MISRA C, the most authoritative subset of "C" for the
development of high-integrity systems.

About Roberto: Roberto Bagnara is CTO and Chief Scientist at BUGSENG and
professor of Computer Science at the University of Parma. He coauthored more
than 40 papers, in international journals and conference proceedings, on
programming languages, static analysis and other techniques for software
verification. He started working on embedded systems' software in 1984, first at
the University of Bologna (medical devices) and then at CERN (particle physics
apparata) where he worked with Tim Berners-Lee. He is a member of the MISRA C
Working Group and of the ISO JTC1/SC22/WG14 international standardization
working group for the C programming language.
