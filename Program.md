## Upcoming events

### Meetup #3: Building SW everyone can trust: Safety requirements in Automotive applications (March 18, 2020)

I am happy to announce the third meetup and this time we are going to do it
online. Most likely we will use a Zoom call but I am still deciding on this.
Stay tuned, the details will follow!

Oleg Kirovskii – "Building SW everyone can trust: Safety requirements in
Automotive applications"

The abstract:

> For many applications, SW is at the same time key enabler and the main risk;
> it may create millions of profits or cause a disastrous accident killing the
> project. Another difference between HW and SW is the non-random nature of SW
> faults: every bug we produce goes into each copy of SW; it will definitely
> manifest under certain conditions. Due to all this, specific safety
> requirements were put on SW, its composition, quality, and development
> processes. This presentation presents a high-level overview of the
> requirements. It introduces the concepts of ISO 26262 standard, explaining its
> view on the terms everyone seems to understand a bit differently: safety,
> risk, harm, etc. The approaches to be outlined here are coming from the
> Automotive engineering community. However, they are also good to handle any
> kind of unwanted events caused by unexpected SW behavior: both related to
> safety in other fields (machinery, aerospace, etc.) and not directly
> safety-related.

> About Oleg: Oleg Kirovskii graduated from Bauman Moscow State Technical
> University in 2009. Since then, he is trying to solve a single question: "How
> to make complex systems safe?" - first in academia, and since 2012 in the
> industry. Since 2014, Oleg concentrates on automotive electronics: first,
> passive safety applications, and starting from August 2017 on driver
> assistance and autonomous driving.

Agenda:

- 19:00: Intro and Presentation
- 20:00-20:15: Time for questions

## Past events

### Meetup #1: Software Verification for Developers (January 15, 2020)

Video recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZNtu4TMz8

I am happy to announce the first meetup and the first speaker.

Dr. Yegor Derevenets – "Software Verification for Developers"

The abstract:

> Sometimes, when you build software, you want to be sure that you have built it
> right. Examples include software for safety-critical systems, code that works
> with data from untrusted sources (e.g., protocol parsers), parallel
> algorithms, which are usually impossible to get right the first time, and many
> more. Software verification gives you a helping hand in such cases.

> In this talk I will give an overview of the software verification methods and
> highlight those that can be used without diving deeply into the theory. The
> survey will cover methods for ensuring correctness: theorem proving, model
> checking, — as well as methods for bug hunting: from good old testing to
> automatic test generation using concolic testing and fuzzing, and making
> compiler write checks for you.

> Yegor is a Software Engineer at Yandex.Technology GmbH.

Agenda:

- 19:30: Open doors
- 19:50: Intro

### Meetup #2: Introduction to Coq theorem prover (February 26, 2020)

I didn't have to look for the next speaker. He has found us!

Evgenii Kuznetcov – "Introduction to Coq theorem prover"

The abstract:

> In this talk, I'm going to show the power of Coq proof assistant. We will go
> through usage examples, do some live coding. In the meanwhile, I'll be making
> an overview of beautiful ideas behind this language such as inductive data
> types and Curry-Howard correspondence.

> Evgenii Kuznetcov is a software developer at Adsquare. Functional programming
> enthusiast.

Location and time: February 26th, 18:00.

Agenda:

- 18:00: Open doors
- 18:30: Intro and Presentation
- 19:30: Networking and drinks
